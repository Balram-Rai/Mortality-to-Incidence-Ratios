# Mortality-to-Incidence-Ratios
Mortality-to-Incidence(MI) ratios are used as an indirect measure for cancer survival in a given population. The motivation to use this measure derives from the lack of detailed time-to-event data. We present a regression modelling approach for MI ratio with the help of a simulated data. The idea is to use the 1 - M/I as a measure to compare the survival between two groups which could be included as covariates in the regression model in terms of log(HR) and log(OR).
